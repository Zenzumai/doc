We are very pleased to announce that continuousphp now support GitLab repository. 

<!--more-->

GitLab is a well-known repository hosting platform. We had many users who asked for its integration with continuousphp. So [here](https://app.continuousphp.com) it is! 

If you are already logged in with a different repository provider, and want to use GitLab, logout and login again.
